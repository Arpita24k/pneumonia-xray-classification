# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays

## Overview
Classify chest X-ray images as "Normal" or "Pneumonia" using deep learning (CNNs).  
Dataset: [Kaggle Chest X-ray Pneumonia Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)

## Goals
- Build and train a CNN for medical image classification
- Analyze results and compare models
- Document methodology and findings

## Project Steps
1. Data exploration & visualization
2. Preprocessing & augmentation
3. Model building (CNN, transfer learning)
4. Training & validation
5. Evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC)
6. Documentation & sharing

## Results
- Best model accuracy: XX%
- Confusion matrix, ROC curve (see `docs/`)
- Sample predictions

## How to Run
1. Clone repo, create folders as above
2. Download data and place in `data/`
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run notebooks in `notebooks/`
